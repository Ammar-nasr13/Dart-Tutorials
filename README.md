- The class have properties and methods.
- you can use properties and methods with objects.

5- **Garbage Collection** => Dart has a built-in memory management system that automatically frees up memory that is no longer in use. <br>

- Garbage Collection frees up memory automatically during run program.

**Data are fressed up** 

- Variables or object that are stored in memory but not used in the program.
- Variables or object that have been assigned a new value will have the old value deleted.
- After executing the functions, the local variables are deleted from memory.

- *Note* => After the program ends: The operating system completely frees all the memory allocated to the program.
