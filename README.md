## what is Dart language ?

- open source programming language => this mean you can download , use , modify and publish it.
- It developed by Google in 2011.
- It used to a client side and server side. (front-end - back-end)
- It a cross platform used to create mobile , desktop and web applications.
- Native language. => It means that the Dart language does not need an intermediary ( compilor ) to translate its code into code that a machine can understand.

## What are the components of the Dart language?

1- **Objects** => every thing in dart is object . this mean this object have classes . classes have super classes.
- The class and object have the same name. EX : int - double - string => classes , EX: num is super class => int -double class
- The class have properties and methods.
- you can use properties and methods with objects.

2- **Functions** => Dart have function and support arrow function.

3- **Asynchrony**

4- **OOP**

5- **Garbage Collection** => Dart has a built-in memory management system that automatically frees up memory that is no longer in use. <br>

- Garbage Collection frees up memory automatically during run program.

**Data are fressed up** 

- Variables or object that are stored in memory but not used in the program.
- Variables or object that have been assigned a new value will have the old value deleted.
- After executing the functions, the local variables are deleted from memory.

- *Note* => After the program ends: The operating system completely frees all the memory allocated to the program.

## How does Dart language work?

- Dart works in different ways depending on the target environment, whether it's a web or a mobile application.
- There are two main mechanisms for running Dart code.
  
  ### (JIT - Just-In-Time Compilation )
  - It used to Development stage.
  - It store Dart code to VM Dart to convert Dart Code to machine code.
  - Support Hot Reload.
  - size of app is big and slow.
  - It used keyword dart run or flutter run.



  ### (AOT - Ahead-Of-Time Compilation)
 - It used to production or publisher stage.
  - It convert Dart Code to Native code ( machine code ) only once.
  - Don't Support Hot Reload.
  - size of app is small and fast.
  - It used keyword flutter bulid.

## what are features of Dart language ?
- Open source.
- Easy to understand => Dart syntax similar to C# and Java Syntax.
- Browser Support => Dart code convert to Javascript code using dart2js tool.
- OOP
- Asyncronus programming
- Type Safety
- flexible compilation and Excution.

## what are versions of Dart language ?

- 2011 => It was announced as an alternative to JavaScript in browsers. 
- 2013 => release Dart 1.0 => the first use in the browser.
- 2018 => release Dart 2.0 => using Dart with Flutter Framework.
- 2023 => release Dart 3.0 => adding Features to Dart.
- **New Versions** =>  [*Wkat's New*](https://dart.dev/resources/whats-new)
